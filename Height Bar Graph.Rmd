This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

First, we're going to download the data file from the web: 

```{r}
download.file(url = "http://libguides.colostate.edu/ld.php?content_id=27156359",
              destfile = "ex1.csv", 
              method="libcurl")
```

Now we're going to load the data from the file into an R variable

```{r}
height<-read.csv("ex1.csv", row.names="Country")
```

Now let's plot the data:

```{r}

counts<-t(as.matrix(height)) #converts the variable height to a format that
                              #can be plotted
counts<-counts-145            #transforms the data so it looks like the excel plot
barplot(counts,               #the height of the bar
        beside = TRUE,        #put cols next to eachother
        main="Height by country in males and females",  #plot title
        xlab="Country",         #X axis label
        ylab="Height (cm)",     #Y axis label
        col=c("blue", "red"),   #bar colors
        offset=145,             #shifts the axis to make it look like excel
        ylim=c(145,190),        #y axis limits
        las=1)                  #horizontal text

legend(x=0, y=190, #coordinates of where you want the legend to go 
       legend=c("Males", "Females"), #legend text label
       col=c("blue", "red"),         #colors 
       pch=15)                       #shape of legend
```
